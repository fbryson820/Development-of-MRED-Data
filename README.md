# Development-of-MRED-Data
Data and Analysis as part of the Development of the Miniature Robotic Electrodialysis (MR ED) System for Small-Scale Desalting of Liquid Samples with Recovery of Organics

A Jupyter notebook is used as a laboratory notebook and contains the data and some visualization. Timeseries data collected for the power and conductivity sensing is stored in /Data, and is accessed by the jupyter notebok.

Publicly accessible [link to Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fbryson820/Development-of-MRED-Data.git/main?labpath=Development%20of%20the%20Miniature%20Robotic%20Electrodialysis%20(MR%20ED)%20System%20for%20Small-Scale%20Desalting%20of%20Liquid%20Samples%20with%20Recovery%20of%20Organics.ipynb) via Binder is available.
